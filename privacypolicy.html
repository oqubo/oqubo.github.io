                            <p>Under no circumstance will Oqubo collect sensitive information from children. Oqubo is not currently collecting any sensitive information from minors and all its mobile apps include strict parental controls in order to protect children from accidental purchases or unwanted publicity.
                            </p>
                            <p>The only personal data we collect is: cookies, unique device identifiers for advertising (Google advertiser ID or IDFA, for example) and usage data.
                            </p>
                            <p>We also advise reading this privacy policy since by allowing your children to use our services you are agreeing to this privacy policy on their behalf. If you disagree, please do not allow your child to use our apps.

                            <h2>Security</h2>
                            <p>We use administrative, physical, and technical measures designed to protect the information that we collect from and about you (including personal information) from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When you provide us with sensitive information, we encrypt the transmission of such information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
                            </p>
                            <p>Where we use third-party service providers to collect, store or otherwise process personal information on our behalf, it is our policy to require those third parties by contract to also have in place appropriate administrative, physical, and technical measures to protect against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
